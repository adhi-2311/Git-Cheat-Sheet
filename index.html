					<!--Intro -->
		            <li id="command0" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail">What is Git?
		            Git is a free, open source DVCS( Distributed Version Control System)
		            designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and 
		            efficiency.
		            Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, 
		            and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. 
		            Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be 
		            merged into one source. 
		            </li>
                     
                    <!--Installation-->
            		<li id="command1" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail ">Installation

            		</li>
                    
                    <!--Configure your Git-->
            		<li id="command2" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail ">Configure your Git 
                    Git uses username to associate commits with an identity by using the <b>git config </b>command.
                    <code>git config --global user.name "my name"</code>
                    <br>
                    Any future commits pushed to github will be associated with this email address.
                    <code>git config --global user.email "me@example.com" </code>
            		</li>

                    <!--Intialise-->
                    <li id="command3" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail ">Initialise a git repository
            		The <b>git init </b>command creates an empty Git repo in your specified directory
            		<code>cd path/to/your/directory</code>
            		<code> git init</code>
                    This will create an empty git repo in the specified directory
            		</li>
                    
                    <!--Opeartions-->
                    <li id="command4" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail ">Git operations
                    To create a local copy of a remote repo we use the <b>git clone </b>
            		<code>cd path/to/your/directory</code> (Where you want the remote repo to be stored locally)
            		<code>git clone path/to/repo </code>
                    This will create a directory having the same name as the "cloned" repo, initialises a 
                    .git directory in it, pulls down all the data and creates a working copy of that repo locally
            		</li>
            		
            		<!--Workflow-->
            		<li id="command5" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail ">Git Workflow
                    The local repo consists of three "trees" maintained by git
                       1. Working Directory that holds the actual files.
                       2. Index that acts as staging area
                       3. HEAD that points to the last commit made.
            		</li>

            		<!--Add Command-->
            		<li id="command6" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail ">Git Add
                    The <b>git add</b> command adds a file to the staging area for the next commit.
                    <code>git add example_file</code>
                       OR
                    <code>git add . </code>
            		</li>
                    
                    <!--Git Status-->
            		<li id="command7" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail ">Git Status
                    The <b>git status</b> command shows the different states of files in working directory
                    and staging area,like files that are modified but unstaged and files staged but not 
                    commited.
                    It is always a good idea to check on what branch one is before commiting changes
                    <code>git status</code>
            		</li>
                    
                    <!--Git Commit-->
            		<li id="command8" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail ">Git Commit
                    The <b>git commit</b> command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.
                    It stores the current contents of the INDEX in a new commit along with commit message.

                    <code>git commit -m "descriptive message" </code>

                    A commit message is a log message from the user describing the changes.

            		</li>

                    <!--Push command-->
            		<li id="command9" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail "> Git Push
                    The file after commiting is commited in the HEAD of your local working copy and is not yet 
                    in your remote repository.
                    
                    To send those changes from local -> remote repository, 
                    we use <b>git push</b> command.
                    <code>git push origin master</code>
                    Enter the Github username and password to prompt the associated remote repo 
                    to push changes.
            		</li>
                    
                    <!--Branching in git-->
            		<li id="command10" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail "> Branching in Git
                    Branches are useful to develop features isolated from each other.
                    The <b>master</b> branch is the default branch when a repo is created.
                    Creating a new branch means creating a new pointer to move around.
                    <code>git branch testing</code>
                    This created a new branch but has not switched to it.
                    <code>git checkout testing</code>
                    This command switches to an existing branch "testing".

                    OR
                    You can directly perform the above operation as:
                    <code>git checkout -b testing</code>

                    A branch is not available to others unless it is pushed to remote repo.
                    <code>git push origin testing</code>

                    * Move back to master branch by:
                    <code>git checkout master</code>

                    * Delete an existing branch by:
                    <code>git branch -d testing</code>
            		</li>
                    
                    <!--Git log-->
            		<li id="command11" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail "> Git Log
                    The <b>git log</b> command lists the commits made in a repo in reverse chronological
                    order i.e most recent commits are shown first.

                    <code>git log</code>
                    
                    One of the more helpful options is -p or --patch, which shows the difference 
                    introduced in each commit. One can also limit the number of log entries displayed, 
                    such as using -2 to show only the last two entries.

                    <code>git log -p -2</code>
            		</li>

                    <!--Fetch and Pull-->
            		<li id="command12" class="list-group-item command-thumbnail "> Git Fetch and Git Pull
            	    When downloading content from a remote repo, git pull and git fetch commands
            	    are available to accomplish the task. 

                    The <b>git fetch</b> command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository 
                    into your local repo but not update your local repo's working state, 
                    leaving your current work intact.

                    <code>git fetch remote_repo</code>
                    Fetches all of the branches from the repository. 
                    This also downloads all of the required commits and files from the other repository.
                    
                   
                    <code>git fetch remote_repo branch_name</code>
                    Fetches only specific branch from remote repo.

                    To synchronize the local repository:
                    Suppose, your team member has added some new features to your remote repository. 
                    So, to add these updates to your local repository, use the git fetch command. 
                    <code>git fetch origin</code>  
                    
                    <!--Pull-->
                    The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository 
                    and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 

                    Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task 
                    in Git-based collaboration work flows. 

                    The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, 
                    git fetch followed by git merge. 

                    In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch scoped to the 
                    local branch that HEAD is pointed at. 
                    Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge workflow.
                    A new merge commit will be-created and HEAD updated to point at the new commit.
                    <code>git pull repo_name</code>

                    A pull request is a commit or series of commits that you send to the owner of the repository
                    so that they incorporate it into their tree.
                    
                    Most open source projects have "Contributing Guideliness" (eg: CONTRIBUTING.md file) 
                    in their repos. Make sure to go through the guideliness before making a PR.
